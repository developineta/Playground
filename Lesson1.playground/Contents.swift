Announced in 2014, the Swift programming language has quickly become\n one of the fastest growing languages in history. \(swift) makes it easy to write software that is incredibly\n fast and safe by \(swift). \(swift) goals for \(swift) are ambitious: we want to make programming simple things easy, and difficult things\n possible. For students, learning \(swift) has been a great introduction to modern programming concepts and best practices. And because\n it is open, their \(swift) skills will be able to be applied to an even broader range of platforms, from mobile devices to the desktop to the cloud.")
